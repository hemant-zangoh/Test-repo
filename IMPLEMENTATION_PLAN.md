# Implementation Plan: New Task

## Task Overview
**Task Name:** New Task  
**Type:** Full-Stack Feature Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** 5 days  

## Task Description (Dummy Data)
Implement a user authentication system with the following features:
- User registration with email verification
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control (Admin, User roles)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- React-based login/registration forms
- Form validation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Protected route implementation

### Backend Requirements
- RESTful API endpoints for auth operations
- User model with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Email service integration for verification
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Database migrations for user table

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Input sanitization
- Secure session management

## Execution Checklist

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Day 1)
- [x] Set up development branch
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Set up database connection
- [x] Configure email service
- [x] Set up testing framework

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation (Day 2-3)
- [x] Create user database schema
- [x] Implement user model
- [x] Create authentication middleware
- [x] Implement registration endpoint
- [x] Implement login endpoint
- [x] Implement logout endpoint
- [x] Implement password reset flow
- [x] Add email verification logic
- [x] Write unit tests for auth logic
- [x] Implement rate limiting

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Day 3-4)
- [x] Create login component
- [x] Create registration component
- [x] Create password reset component
- [x] Implement form validation
- [x] Add authentication context/provider
- [x] Implement protected routes
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Style components
- [x] Ensure responsive design
- [ ] Write component tests

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Test full authentication flow
- [ ] Test email verification flow
- [ ] Test password reset flow
- [ ] Perform security testing
- [ ] Fix any bugs found
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Prepare for code review

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation (Day 5)
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Update environment configs
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Prepare database migrations
- [ ] Final testing in staging environment

## Dependencies
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, Material-UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, JWT, Bcrypt, Nodemailer
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library

## Risk Assessment
1. **Email Service Integration** - May require additional configuration
2. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Need thorough testing across devices
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Require security audit before deployment
4. **Performance** - Monitor auth endpoint response times

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All authentication endpoints working correctly
- [ ] Email verification functional
- [ ] UI responsive on all devices
- [ ] All tests passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Security best practices implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan and adjust based on actual requirements
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Daily progress updates on Monday.com
